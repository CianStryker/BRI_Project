# Code File Guide

- Each tab of the website has a separate rmd file whose title corresponds to a website tab title. All four of these rmd files can be found here. 

- The "Prep" rmd file simply takes the figures and data from the other four rmd files and creates images or R object from them. Then it saves them to the proper locations in the "Website" file that can be found in the main repo. 

- The "raw-data" file simply contains the three datasets that I used for this project.
