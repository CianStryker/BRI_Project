# China and the Belt and Road Initiative
In this project I am analyzing China's use of foreign direct investment, especially any investment that is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The project is largley descriptive in nature although I do use some statistical modeling in the form of regressions to demonstrate what economic and political factors may influence Chinese investment decisions.

# About me
My name is Cian Stryker and I am a graduate student at Harvard University. I am pursuing a Master’s in Russian, Eastern European, and Central Asian studies with a focus on the Digital Silk Road, or the digital aspect of the Belt and Road Initiative. I am especially interested in the digital expansion of Chinese technology and data management systems in Central Asia. This report was the final project for my ‘Data’ class at Harvard (GOV 1005).
